    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Photos & Files Recovery helps users recover deleted photos, videos, audios, and documents. The app also provides tools to back up and restore contacts locally on the device only, remove duplicate files, clean cached WhatsApp media, and delete junk files.</p>
    <p>All recovery and cleaning operations are performed directly on the user's device. We do not collect, store, or share any personal data or recovered files with third parties.</p>
    <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that you have full control over your files while using the app.</p>

    <h2>Permissions and Their Uses</h2>
    <p>To provide reliable file recovery and cleaning features, Photos & Files Recovery requires access to certain parts of your device. Below is a clear explanation of why each permission is needed and how it is used:</p>
    
    <div class="permission-type">
        <p class="permission-title">Contacts Permission:</p>
        <p>These permissions allow the app to back up and restore your contacts directly on your device. For example, if you accidentally delete a contact, the app can restore it from the local backup. Your contact list is never uploaded to any server and remains only on your phone.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="permission-type">
        <p class="permission-title">Storage Permission (for Android 10 and below):</p>
        <p>The app needs access to your storage to scan for deleted photos, videos, audios, and documents. With this permission, the app can check your memory for files that can be recovered, and also save recovered files back to your device. Without this access, file recovery would not be possible.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="permission-type">
        <p class="permission-title">Full Access Permission (for Android 11 and above):</p>
        <p>Starting from Android 11, access to files is more restricted. This permission is required so the app can fully access your files and folders to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Recover deleted photos, videos, audios, and documents.</li>
            <li>Detect and remove duplicate files that waste space.</li>
            <li>Clean up cached WhatsApp media to free storage.</li>
            <li>Delete unnecessary junk files.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This permission is used only for recovery and cleaning tasks, and your data is never collected or shared outside your device.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Important Notes:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Before requesting any permission, the app displays an explanatory message to inform the user why the permission is needed, ensuring full transparency.</li>
        <li>Permissions are requested only when a feature requiring them is used. No permission is activated automatically or in the background.</li>
    </ul>
